# The 20 Most Important Mathematical Equations

A journey through the most elegant and influential formulas in mathematics

| 1. Euler’s Identity | 3. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \) | \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) \) |
| Connects five fundamental constants (e, i, π, 1, 0), revealing the profound relationship between exponential functions and trigonometry. | Establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. If F is an antiderivative of f, the definite integral equals F(b) - F(a). Revolutionized mathematical problem-solving. |

| 2. Pythagorean Theorem | 4. Maxwell’s Equations |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \) | \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \) |
| In right triangles, the hypotenuse squared equals the sum of the squares of the other sides. Cornerstone of geometry with applications in navigation and architecture. | \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \) |
| | \( \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \) |
| | \( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \) |
| | Unified electricity and magnetism as manifestations of the same force. Describes electromagnetic field behavior, predicting waves traveling at light speed. Enabled technologies from radio to smartphones. |
