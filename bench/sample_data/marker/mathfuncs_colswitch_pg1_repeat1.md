## **The 20 Most Important Mathematical Equations**

A journey through the most elegant and influential formulas in mathematics

3. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 1. Euler's Identity  $e^{i\pi}+1=0$  $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$ Connects five fundamental constants (e, i,  $\pi$ , 1, 0), revealing the profound relationship between exponential functions and Establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse trigonometry. operations. If F is an antiderivative of f, the definite integral equals F(b) - F(a). Revolutionized mathematical problem-solving. 2. Pythagorean Theorem 4. Maxwell's Equations  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ 

In right triangles, the hypotenuse squared equals the sum of the squares of the other sides. Cornerstone of geometry with applications in navigation and architecture.

$$\begin{aligned} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \ \nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \end{aligned}$$

Unified electricity and magnetism as manifestations of the same force. Describes electromagnetic field behavior, predicting waves traveling at light speed. Enabled technologies from radio to smartphones.
